## What's this?

A simple game of rock, paper, scissors<br/>
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors

### What's here?

* [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to hit the ground running with a sensible build configuration
* [`Jest`](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) to test components and logic
* `Just enough CSS` for the simple UI

### What's not?

* `Redux / mobx` / other state management, which at this stage hurts more than helps
* `RxJS` which I love, but has no place here
* `CSS frameworks` to bloat the file size
* `CSS preprocessors` to add to dev setup and build time

### What's next?

As this evolves towards something like [`Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock`](https://rpsls.net), additions may include:
* Better use of HTML meta data for search engines, social media, and bookmarking on mobile OSs
* [`sass`](https://sass-lang.com/) or [`stylus`](http://stylus-lang.com/) to help manage and auto-prefix rules
* [`redux-observables`](https://github.com/redux-observable/redux-observable) to ease asynchronous state change
* and more as we go along...
